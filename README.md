# MovieInfos

The goal of the project is creating a simple utility to help me produce newsletters and articles in HTML for http://www.cferrari.it. 
A python webapp may seem a bit of overkill (I already have a simpler one coded in Javascript), but it's a good learning chance to understand the basis of python webapp development.
